# Dumb-Charades-Game
This game requires the person to act the element showed to him/her without opening his/her mouth.

## Reason for Creation 

- My siblings and myself use to play the game with Bible Characters. 
- While one quietly shares the character, the person enacts the elements of the character's life and relate stuff. 
- By this way, the character is found by the rest of the team.

## Features
- Eliminates the person who shares the random character 
- Generates a character from the data provided 
- Data is in a seperate file named Data.py
- Data can be updated manually without confusion in code. 

## Possiblities
 You can clone the file and change the data according to your wish and play the same.
